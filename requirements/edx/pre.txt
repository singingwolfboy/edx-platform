# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!

# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should notify:
#   * @jtauber - to check licensing
#   * One of @e0d, @jarv, or @feanil - to check system requirements

# Numpy and scipy can't be installed in the same pip run.
# Install numpy before other things to help resolve the problem.
